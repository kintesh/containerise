|Select your container and add a domain to always open all visits in the chosen container. | Add many domains as you wish. | Special `No Container` option to break out of a container. | Simple CSV based mapping of a domain to a container by name for easy backup and bulk editing. |


# Installation
Install the latest release for Firefox from [AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/containerise/)



# Usage

## Basic mapping

`amazon.co.uk, Shopping` will open all amazon.co.uk (not subdomains) links in Shopping container.

## Glob
`!*.amazon.co.uk, Shopping`  will be treated as `*.amazon.co.uk` glob pattern. (suitable to subdomains)

## Regex

`@.+\.amazon\.co\.uk$, Shopping` will be treat as `.+\.amazon\.co\.uk$` regex. (suitable to subdomains and complex paths)

## Matching with existing container name
With the option "Match current container name" turned on:

`<>amazon.co.uk, Shopping` will open all amazon.co.uk (not subdomains) links in Shopping container, but only if not already in a container

`@<shopping>(?!.+\.amazon\.co\.uk).*, No Container` will open all links from inside the Shopping continer that are _not_ to .amazon.co.uk subdomains in the default No Container

`@<(?!profile \d).*>.+\.facebook.com$, Profile 1` will open all links to facebook.com in Profile 1 container, unless they are already in Profile 1, Profile 2, Profile 3 etc.
