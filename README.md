# Usage

## Basic mapping

`amazon.co.uk, Shopping` will open all amazon.co.uk (not subdomains) links in Shopping container.

## Glob
`!*.amazon.co.uk, Shopping`  will be treated as `*.amazon.co.uk` glob pattern. (suitable to subdomains)

## Regex

`@.+\.amazon\.co\.uk, Shopping` will be treated as `.+\.amazon\.co\.uk` regex. (suitable to subdomains and complex paths)
